        <h3 class="mt-5">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</h3>
        <p>
          Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA),
          eligible students are afforded certain rights about school records and
          personally identifiable information on file with the institution. An
          eligible student is defined as any person who is currently enrolled or
          has been enrolled in the institution’s program. It is the policy of
          the institution to treat all student information, both personal and
          academic, as strictly confidential.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Students may request access to their academic records from the
          Academic Registrar. Student information is not available to any
          outside party unless the student requests, by written authorization,
          the records to be shared. This written consent must include:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
          <li style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px">
            the purpose of the disclosure
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px">
            the records that may be disclosed
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px">
            the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px">
            a signature and date
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Student Identity Verification Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The application packet requires students to submit a government-issued
          photo ID (e.g., driver’s license or passport).
        </p>
        <p>
          For senior exams, students fill out a Graduate Exam Declaration Form
          which includes their name and driver’s license (or similar). Exams are
          proctored, and you must show the proctor a government-issued photo ID.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Student Grievance Policy</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          When student grievances arise, students should contact the persons
          directly involved to seek a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any grievances should be handled professionally. Direct and
          responsible communication with the faculty and staff is expected. If a
          satisfactory solution cannot be reached, students may then contact the
          Distance Education Dean.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a satisfactory solution is not reached at this level, the student
          may appeal in writing to the President of HBIU.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the student is still not satisfied that his or her grievance is
          handled satisfactorily he or she may contact the grievance department.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">HBIU Transfer of Credits Policy</h3>
        <p>

          a transcript from an accredited university, a course syllabus, and, if
          possible, any coursework that was submitted to the original faculty.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Each course being considered must meet or exceed the outcomes
          assessments for the requested life experience credit.
