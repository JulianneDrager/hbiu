        <h3 class="mt-5">Sexual Harassment Policy and Complaint/Investigation Procedure</h3>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Objective</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The objective of this policy is to define workplace sexual harassment and to outline procedures for filing
          complaints, investigating sexual harassment claims, and issuing appropriate disciplinary measures in the case
          of violations.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          <b>Scope</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy applies to all employees of [Heart Bible Institute] at all locations. All workers, at every level,
          will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge, for any violation of this policy. Employees are
          prohibited from harassing others both on and off the employer premises and during or outside of work hours.
        </p>

      </div>

      <!-- Defining Sexual Harassment ------------------------------>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Defining Sexual Harassment</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is persistent or offensive and interferes with
          an employee's job performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Sexual
          harassment is defined by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as unwelcome sexual advances,
          requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example: a)
          submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's
          employment, b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment
          decisions affecting such individual, or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
          with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Sexual harassment can be physical and psychological in nature. An aggregation of incidents can constitute
          sexual harassment even if one of the incidents considered on its own would not be harassing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Examples of prohibited conduct ---------------------------->
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt-5">Examples of Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Though sexual harassment encompasses a wide range of conduct, some examples of specifically prohibited conduct
          include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Physical assaults of a sexual nature, such as rape,
            sexual battery, molestation, or attempts to commit these assaults, and intentional physical conduct that is
            sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, or brushing against another employee's body
            or poking another employee's body.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Unwelcome sexual advances, propositions, or other
            sexual comments, such as sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes, or comments about a person's
            sexuality or sexual experience.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Preferential treatment or promises of preferential
            treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual conduct, including soliciting or attempting to solicit any
            employee to engage in sexual activity for compensation or reward.

          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Subjecting, or threats of subjecting, an employee to
            unwelcome sexual attention or conduct or intentionally making the performance of the employee's job more
            difficult because of that employee's sex.

          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications
            anywhere in [Company Name]'s workplace by the [Company Name] employees.

          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Retaliation for sexual harassment complaints.

        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Employees</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If an employee feels that he or she is being subjected to sexual harassment he or she may immediately inform
          the harasser that the conduct is unwelcome and needs to stop. If the inappropriate conduct does not cease, or
          if the employee is unable to or uncomfortable with addressing the alleged harasser directly, he or she should
          report the incident to his or her supervisor or the human resource (HR) director. It is helpful, but not
          required, to provide a written record of the date, time, and nature of the incident(s) and the names of any
          witnesses.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          It is important to report all concerns of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual conduct to the HR director
          or a supervisor/manager as soon as possible. Management must be made aware of the situation so that it can
          conduct an immediate and impartial investigation and take appropriate action to remediate or prevent the
          prohibited conduct from continuing.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Managers and supervisors</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Managers and supervisors must deal expeditiously and fairly when they have any knowledge of sexual harassment
          within their departments, whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint. They must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Take all complaints or concerns of alleged or possible
            harassment seriously no matter how minor or who is involved.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Report all incidents to HR immediately so that a prompt
            investigation can occur.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">Take any appropriate action to prevent retaliation or
            prohibited conduct from recurring during and after any investigations or complaints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Managers and supervisors who knowingly allow or tolerate sexual harassment or retaliation, including the
          failure to immediately report such misconduct to HR, violate this policy and are subject to discipline.

          <strong>Complaint Resolution Procedures</strong>

          Complaints should be submitted as soon as possible after an incident has occurred, preferably in writing. The
          HR director may assist the complainant in completing a written statement or, in the event an employee refuses
          to provide information in writing, the HR director will dictate the verbal complaint.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          To ensure the prompt and thorough investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, the complainant should
          provide as much of the following information as possible:

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: number; margin-left: 40px;">The name, department, and position of the person or

            subject to the same or similar harassment.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: number; margin-left: 40px;">What, if any, steps the complainant has taken to try
            to stop the harassment?</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: number; margin-left: 40px;">Any other information the complainant believes to be

        <h3 class="mt-5">Discipline</h3>
        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Discipline</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Employees who violate this policy are subject to appropriate discipline. If an investigation results in a
          finding that this policy has been violated, the mandatory minimum discipline is a written reprimand. The
          discipline for very serious or repeat violations is the termination of employment. Persons who violate this
          policy may also be subject to civil damages or criminal penalties.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          All complaints and investigations are treated confidentially to the extent possible and information is
          disclosed strictly on a need-to-know basis. The identity of the complainant is usually revealed to the parties
          involved during the investigation and the HR director takes adequate steps to ensure that the complainant is
          protected from retaliation during and after the investigation. All information pertaining to a sexual
          harassment complaint or investigation is maintained in secure files within the HR department.
