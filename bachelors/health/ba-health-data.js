      `A 'BA in Ministry of Health and Social Services' is not a standard academic degree program. Instead, it appears to be related to employment or a position within a government agency or ministry responsible for health and social services. Program is 4 Years but can complete in 3. In many countries, government ministries or departments oversee public health initiatives, healthcare systems, and social welfare programs.
