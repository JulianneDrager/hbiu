      "<div>All candidates seeking to obtain a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Applied Science, or Bachelor of Science degree from HBIU must adhere to the following general requirements for graduation: It is important to note that additional criteria may apply to specific programs.</div>",
      "<div class='mt-3'>To qualify for graduation, students are required to successfully complete a total of 120 credit hours. Of these, at least 30 credit hours must be earned at HBIU. It is important to note that developmental education courses (previously known as college preparatory courses) do not count toward the total credit hours needed for residency or graduation.</div>",
      "<div class='mt-3'>To be awarded a bachelor's degree, students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in major-specific courses. Additionally, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or above on a 4.0 scale for all coursework undertaken at HBIU, as well as a combined GPA of 3.0 or higher that includes all transferable credits.</div>",
      "<div class='mt-3'>A grade of C+ or higher is required in all upper-division program courses. Students must also fulfill the general education requirements, which consist of 36 credit hours as outlined in the Associate in Arts degree. Those transferring to HBIU with an Associate in Arts degree or a Bachelor's degree are deemed to have satisfied the general education requirements. For students transferring without these degrees, courses will be evaluated for equivalency.</div>",
      "<div class='mt-3'>Lastly, students must complete a foreign language requirement prior to graduation. This requirement can be met in one of the following ways:</div>",
      '<div class="ms-3">A) Successful completion of two years (four semesters) of the same foreign language, as documented on a high school transcript.</div>',
