      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'>Identify and implement treatment approaches that apply evidence-based theories and enhance clients' wellness</li>`,

      `<div class='mt-3'>PhD programs in clinical mental health counseling require a master's degree and three to four years of coursework. It includes a clinical internship, research dissertation, and counseling practicum. Depending on the program and enrollment status, it may take 3 – 4 years to graduate.</div>`,

      `<div class='mt-3'><b>Some of what you will spend time studying?</b></div>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Developmental Psychology</b> – Like all PsyD students, you’ll probably start off your program by learning a bit about the stages of human development through the lifespan. This will cover both theories of neuropsychology and the applied aspects of developmental changes.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>History of Counseling Psychology</b> – Some courses will cover the history of psychology as a field, including the major branches of theory and practice, from behaviorism to psychoanalysis, that have emerged along the way. In a counseling and mental health specialization, you’ll focus in on the specific uses that psychology has found in the field of counseling and how it has influenced health and wellness practices in healthcare today.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Theoretical Psychotherapy and Counseling</b> – The current major perspectives on counseling and psychotherapies will be covered with critical and differential perspectives to give you a solid grounding in the types of practice you may perform in the field.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Psychopathology</b> – In order to correctly treat patients in counseling, you have to be able to assess them properly. You’ll take courses that offer in-depth studies of mental and behavioral disorders, including possible physical, social, and neurological origins. You’ll learn how to spot the characteristics of mental disorders, diagnose them and develop treatment plans.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Counseling Processes</b> – These courses are where the meat and potatoes of the degree are. You’ll learn about the actual practices to use in therapy sessions. That includes developing the kind of listening skills required of counselors and maintaining the right presence and perspective during counseling sessions. You’ll see how to put treatment plans into practice through a variety of theoretical and actual case studies.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Legal and Ethical Issues in Counseling</b> – Psychology is a field that has to develop unbreakable trust between the counselor and the patient. That means learning and sticking to a strong set of ethical standards as outlined by the APA’s Ethics Code. You’ll also learn about state laws and regulations governing psychologist conduct and responsibilities.</li>`,
      `<li style='list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem'><b>Research and Experimental Design</b> – While a PsyD will not include as much research focus as a PhD program, you will still spend time learning about statistics and experimental design. Building a foundation of knowledge takes an inquisitive mind and the ability to apply logic to any situation, both of which you’ll learn about in these courses.`,

      `<li style='margin-left: 2rem'>The format and structure of these courses will vary from program to program. In some cases, you’ll find yourself following a fixed schedule, with the same exact courses as every other student in the program. In other cases, you’ll find a variety of electives that offer different angles on those general subjects where you can pick and choose the best course to fit your interests.</li>`,

      `<div class='mt-3'><b>The Dissertation Process That Cements Your Education</b></div>`,
      `<div class='mb-20'>The next to last year of your program is generally dedicated to completing the capstone of your studies: a dissertation or doctoral project.</div>`,
      `<div>In most cases, this involves carrying out an original research project in a subject you select in coordination with your advisors and dissertation committee. For some programs, a doctoral project that involves a more practical expression of your studies is accepted or encouraged instead.</div>`,
      `<div class='mt-3'>In both cases, you’ll spend at least a year putting together a project that brings together and demonstrates the sum of your learning. A dissertation can run to 50 pages or more, and you’re likely to go through multiple revisions over the course of months in the process of defending it before it’s finally accepted by the doctoral committee.</div>`,
      `<div class='mt-3'>At the end, you’ll have a publication-worthy piece of writing that contributes something new to the psychology field. They’ll be looking hard at how you conducted your research, how you have applied your knowledge, and what kind of original conclusions you have developed in the process. It’s an extremely tough process, but it’s part of what makes a doctoral graduate the best in the business of counseling.</div>`,
