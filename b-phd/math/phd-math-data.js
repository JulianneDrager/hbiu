      `<div>A Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) Major in Mathematics is a terminal degree that focuses on the advanced study of
  mathematics education, preparing educators to lead and transform mathematics teaching and learning in various
  settings. This degree program typically covers:</div>`,

      `<li class='ms-3'>1. Advanced mathematical concepts and pedagogy</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>2. Mathematics education research and theory</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>3. Curriculum design, development, and evaluation</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>4. Teaching and learning strategies for diverse learners</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>5. Assessment and evaluation methods in mathematics education</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3 mb-20'>6. Leadership and policy development in mathematics education</li>`,

      `<div class='mb-1'>Graduates with an Ed.D. in Mathematics Education can pursue careers as:</div>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>1. Mathematics education professors or researchers</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>2. Curriculum specialists or developers</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>3. Mathematics education consultants or coaches</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>4. Education leaders or administrators</li>`,
      `<li class='ms-3'>5. Mathematics teachers or department chairs</li>`,

      `<div class='mt-30'>The Ed.D. in Mathematics Education differs from a Ph.D. in Mathematics Education in its focus on
  practical applications and leadership in education, rather than solely on theoretical research. Key skills and knowledge gained through this degree program include:</div>`,
