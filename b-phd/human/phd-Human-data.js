      `<div class="mb-20">This course will examine health from a holistic and high-level point of view, reviewing elements of culture, geography, environment, political stability, and poverty, among others, as they relate to disparity, prevention, and cure of disease and access to health care. Students will learn about the determinants of health; the inequities that drive disparity; the indicators used to measure population health; and the key disciplines, structures, and stakeholders that work to understand and address all these components to improve health and reduce morbidity and mortality.</div> 
      
      Students will be required to review relevant publications, research pressing Community and Global Public Health issues, and contribute to meaningful discussion about social justice and moral, political, and economic concerns associated with health and disease, applying principles of social and biological sciences as the foundation for their perspectives. Students will gain skills in communication, public speaking, time management, research, writing and creative thinking that are indispensable to any future career. Ultimately, students will gain an understanding of Community and Global Public Health, what it is, who it involves, what disciplines and skills are required to find solutions, and how their interests and passions may intersect with and contribute directly to the objectives of the sector.`,
