      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Clinical Pastoral Education:</b></div>`,
      `<div>Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) is a form of interfaith professional training designed for individuals in ministry. It engages theological students and ministers from various faith traditions—including pastors, priests, rabbis, and others—in supervised interactions with individuals facing crises. Through deep engagement with those in need, along with constructive feedback from peers and instructors, students cultivate a heightened self-awareness and a better understanding of the needs of those they serve. By reflecting theologically on specific human experiences, they acquire a deeper insight into the nature of ministry. Additionally, through collaborative efforts within an interdisciplinary team, they enhance their skills in both interpersonal and interprofessional relationships.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Do I have to be ordained to do CPE?</b></div>`,
      `<div>HBIU requires ordination as a prerequisite.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) Units:</b></div>`,
      `<div>A single "unit" of CPE encompasses 400 hours, including a minimum of 100 hours dedicated to structured group and individual educational activities. Each unit is supplemented by supervised clinical practice in the field of ministry.</div>`,

      `<div>An application for clinical pastoral education can be downloaded and submitted via email. The tuition fee for a CPE unit is $600, and typically, a $50 application fee is also required. You can apply for a scholarship, which can help to lower your cost.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Staff Education:</b></div>`,
      `<div>The pastoral care team provides educational programs tailored for nurses, medical residents, clinical staff who serve as chaplains, and non-clinical staff in chaplaincy roles. These programs address various topics, including grief, end-of-life considerations, respect and dignity, ethics, and issues related to religion and distress.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Field Education for Theology Students:</b></div>`,
      `<div>The pastoral care department partners with seminaries and theological schools to facilitate field education opportunities for students. These experiences involve patient visitation, supervision, and evaluation.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Options for the Program:</b></div>`,
      `<div>CPE courses at Levels I and II are divided into individual modules and are accessible to students. The initial unit of CPE is classified as Level I. Upon achieving the specified learning objectives, individuals may enroll in further units of CPE to enhance their education and skills. Each unit of continuing professional education necessitates a minimum of 400 hours of study, with at least 100 hours allocated to attending educational seminars and receiving supervision, while the remaining 300 hours are dedicated to providing pastoral care within a healthcare setting. Below is a list of the available programs:</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Extended Unit of Clinical Pastoral Education Available on a Part-Time Basis:</b></div>`,
      `<div>These programs may be completed in either five or nine months at a reduced level of commitment. In order to accommodate people who are either attending school or working in other capacities, a part-time schedule has been developed that spans over an extended period of time. Participants are required to maintain a consistent presence in class in addition to getting individual supervision. They are responsible for providing spiritual care in the clinical areas of the hospital that have been allocated to them in accordance with the agenda for the course of the unit.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Clinical Pastoral Education Intensive Unit Available on a Full-Time Summer Basis:</b></div>`,
      `<div>During the months of May through August, students may participate in one full-time CPE unit for a total of ten weeks. Participants are required to work as chaplains in allocated therapeutic areas for a full-time commitment of forty hours per week. Seminars and weekly individual supervision each take up ten of the hours that are allotted to them.</div>`,

      `<div class='mb-1, mt-4'><b>Clinical Pastoral Education Accomplished During a Year Spent in Full-Time Residency:</b></div>`,
      `<div>The Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) Residency program is an educational and clinical program that lasts for a full year. It is meant for religious and spiritual leaders who have been ordained and approved and who have a desire to improve their abilities in the area of spiritual care while also getting ready for board certification. In most years, it starts in September and lasts all the way through the following September. During the academic year, students will earn a total of three CPE units. Participants are expected to work as chaplains in clinical areas for a full-time commitment of forty hours per week, in addition to attending weekly training seminars and receiving individual supervision. Every student has some responsibility that requires them to stay up overnight.</div>`,
