      `<div>This comprehensive program spans one four month, during which participants engage in 1 unit of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) while advancing their ministry skills and preparing for a career in pastoral care.

Students will have the opportunity to provide pastoral care throughout the hospital and will collaborate with multi-disciplinary teams, concentrating their ministry in specific patient care areas, including women's and children’s health, and trauma/emergency care. By the conclusion of the program, students will possess a thorough understanding of the chaplain's role within a healthcare environment. The insights acquired, skills honed, and personal development achieved will equip them for certification. The schedules will include a mix of day, evening, and night shifts, with some weekend and holiday shifts required.</div>`,
