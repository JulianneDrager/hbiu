      <p class="mt-2">Apostle Vee has been in ministry for 18+ years. She responded to the call to ministry in 2007 under the leadership of Pastor William E. Dickinson of Fellowship Hope Church. It was a reward to become familiar with multiple church ministry areas, including using her skills as an administrative assistant and treasurer. She continued with her walk to be a good steward of the mysteries of God by ministering and evangelizing to others. Her passion surrounded mentoring the youth, feeding the homeless, and managing conferences, to name a few. While carrying out her passionate work, she was ordained as a Pastor in 2012.</p>

        biography: `      <p class="mt-2">Walking by faith and not by sight, Apostle Vee pushed forward with her devoted husband, Brother Craig Brown, and three beautiful inspirations, her daughters, Chylicia, Aaliyah, Laila, and two grandchildren. Her family supported her as she received her doctorate from Heart Bible Institute University. After the passing of her dear family members, Debra and Avette Hilton, due to cancer, in 2014, she received a mandate and vision by God to teach God’s graceful word to the heartbroken and those in need of love and restoration through the Infallible Word of God and the leading of the His Holy Spirit. Then, God's Grace Ministries, Grace & Hope Cancer Foundation, and God’s Grace Distribution Center were birthed. As the Founder and Head Pastor, Vee provided residents of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey food, goods, assistance with health care services, transportation, clothes, and much more. As a united member of Hands In Service, goods are shipped globally to provide communities worldwide with food, clothing, and toiletries.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-2">In 2019, busy doing God’s work, Apostle Vee spoke on multi-level platforms teaching and helping to change lives one soul at a time. In 2021, she was ordained as an Apostle. Now, Apostle Vee is teaching and preaching the Word of God alongside her Full Gospel Ministry Family under the leadership of Apostle Seth Baah & Pastor Priscilla Baah. Grace & Hope Cancer Foundation & God’s Grace Distribution Center is thriving and provides the necessary services to local families and individuals can receive food, clothing, and additional resources in the tri-state area. As an impactful servant in the community for over eighteen plus years, Apostle Vee has touched, changed, and supported countless members of numerous societies. Families receive services all year long, especially during the holidays and upon request. Recently, Hands-In Service shipped relief to Ukraine. She continues God’s mission to travel throughout the tri-state areas assisting, feeding, and praying with the homeless, families in need, families around the world, and distributing goods.</p>`,
