      `<div>Many states use the NCE to assess the abilities and knowledge level of potential counselors. Many states require that candidates pass this exam to be eligible for counselor licensure. There are 200 multiple-choice questions on this computer-based exam, covering six domain areas. Domains cover such areas as clinical focus, treatment planning, professional practice, and counseling interventions. A total of 160 of the 200 questions are scored. A modified Angoff method is used to score the exam, so minimum NCE scores vary for each exam version. The time limit for the test is three hours and forty-five minutes.</div>`,
