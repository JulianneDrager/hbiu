      `<div style='color: gray;'>A Master of Arts in Christian Leadership is a graduate-level program designed for individuals who want to deepen their knowledge and skills in Christian leadership. This program is designed to help those involved in various areas of Christian leadership and ministry to be better equipped to take on the wide variety of challenges and opportunities leadership provides. Students will be led through the foundational aspects and implications of leadership, and encouraged to explore and reflect on the many dimensions Christian leadership encompasses and challenged to find ways of applying what they learn to their own areas of service to God and his people. This course is an analysis of the tasks, styles, and models of leadership, giving special emphasis to the biblical guidelines and church context of Christian leadership. In this modern day epoch, religious leaders face various challenges and criticisms, this Christian leadership course combines theological education with practical leadership training to prepare students for roles in ministry, non-profit organizations, and other Christian contexts. The curriculum of the Master of Arts in Christian Leadership program may include courses in biblical studies, theology, Christian ethics, pastoral leadership, organizational behavior, and strategic planning.</div>`,
